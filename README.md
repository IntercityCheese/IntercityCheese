Whatsup folks! I'm InterCitycheese,
I am a Computer science GCSE student learning python
I'm constantly starting way to ambitious pordjects on my RP pico.
My repository has some of the projects i've been working on, and they are made to download and be used right away.
I am pretty new to github so im still learning my way around.

I'll be updating this oage regularly, sort of blog style, with things i've been workinf on.
